##Â Contents

This repository contains examples of software for embedded systems written in Ada. Examples are available for STM32F4 and RaspberryPi boards.

You will need a GNAT cross compiler for the board you are using. Free compilers can be downloaded from the [AdaCore Community site](https://www.adacore.com/community).

The examples have been compiled and tested on an Ubuntu 16.04 x86 host. See the specific folders to read more about setting up the programming environment for different target platforms.
