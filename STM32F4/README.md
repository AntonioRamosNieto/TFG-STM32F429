# STM324F4

## Introduction

This repository contains Ada code examples and documentation for using the *GNAT GPL for ARM ELF* toolchain on STM32F4 boards. 

The examples have been tested on the following boards:

* [STMF429 Discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html): low cost development kit for the STM32F429 micro-controller 

The examples make use of the [Ada Drivers Library](https://github.com/AdaCore/Ada_Drivers_Library).

## Setting up the programming environment

### Install the GNAT GPL for Bare Board ARM compilation chain

The compilation system can be dowlodaded from the [AdaCore Community site](https://www.adacore.com/community). The version used in the following is *ARM ELF (hosted on Linux) - 2017*. If you have been using previous versions of GNAT GPL you should take into account that some directories are now located at different places in the directory tree.

Follow the installation instructions to setup the compiler. Let `<GNAT>` denote the installation root for the  GNAT compilation system. 
The directory `<GNAT>/bin` must be in the execution `PATH` for the compilation tools to be run.

#### Support for 32-bit architecture
The GNAT ARM-ELF compilation tools run on a linux 32 bit i386 architecture. If your linux distribution is for 64 bit x86, you have to enable i386 support before using the tools:

```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libbz2-1.0:i386 libncurses5:i386 libxinerama1:i386 \\
                    libxrender1:i386 libsm6:i386
```

#### ST-LINK support

If you have a board with ST-LINK support for debugging, such as the STM32F429 discovery boards, you also need to download and build the stlink software.

```
git clone https://github.com/texane/stlink stlink
cd stlink
make release
cd build/Release
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
# restart the udev service
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

### Compile, upload and run a simple example

Follow the steps in the [ARM-ELF Topics and Tutorial](https://docs.adacore.com/gnat_ugx-docs/html/gnat_ugx/gnat_ugx/arm-elf_topics_and_tutorial.html) document to open the `led_flasher-stm32f4` example in `<GNAT>/share/examples/gnat-cross/led_flasher-stm32f4`. Compile and build the program, and upload the executable code to the STM32F429 board. 

### Other examples

The examples in this repository can be downloaded and compiled in a similar way as the simple example.
